          <P>
            Practically, this means anybody can hop on ABF and write some
            Brainfuck! code and produce on-chain art.
          </P>
          <P>
            But really, beyond the atomic breakdowns of the composition of ABF,
            it's about something much more... simple.

            Fuck gated access to creation tools. Fuck 10% fee extraction. Fuck

            Gen-art now has become all theatrics. It's about the "alpha" you
            have, the whitelist you are on. The marketing shill you can summon.

            <B>001: </B>See, ABF breaks it all down. We slow it all down. No
            gates to ABF, no IPFS PNGs, no DAO extracting fees or selling their
            blessings.

          <P>
            To the fault of Brainfuck!'s esoterism, creating gen-art with ABF
            rewires the brain. You aren't thinking about token supplies, mint
            prices, or marketing. It's just about getting 8 op-codes working the
            way you want.
          </P>
          <P>It's kinda ... brain-fucky, but its meditative. *chuckles*</P>

          <P>
            <B>001: </B>That's ABF. It's about creating art. It's about not
            creating any blocker to doing it. It's about celebrating the people
            who dare to do it.
          </P>
          <P>
            That is why we want you in the Corps. Not to band together to pump a
            token, but to celebrate together. To struggle together. To ask each
            other to be better.
          </P>
          <P>
            I want to emphasize. ABF is what we make of it. There's no "roadmap"
            in any traditional sense. It's about us making it our home. This is
            as much your story as all of ours. As you learn more about the
            protocol, you will learn just how powerful the protocol is in the
            right pair of hands.
          </P>
          <P>
            Anyways, I welcome you to the Corps. Please treat each other with
            respect. You are all here for the same reason.
